### How to build ###

This library uses [gradle](https://gradle.org/gradle-download/) as build system, and comes with the gradle wrapper included.
So no prior installation on your computer is required! You can just use the `gradlew` or `gradlew.bat` executables in the root of the sources.

To get an overview of all gradle tasks you can use:
```
./gradlew tasks
```


To assemble and test the project, run:
```
./gradlew build
```
